# Project Description

Our project is aimed at creating a multifunctional system for reading people. 
It includes: a tracker for reading, 
storing information about books read (when finished, a review of the book read), 
creating your own collections according to certain criteria (for example, "the 10 best books in the fantasy genre"). 
Thanks to our system, users will be able to track their reading progress and store information about what they have read, but they will also be able to share this information with others (if desired).
