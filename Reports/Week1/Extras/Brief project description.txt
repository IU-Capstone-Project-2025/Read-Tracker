Webite (?) for book tracking

Actions:
Open site
Check profile
Check that user read today (in calendar (on the right?))
Check subscription feed (additional maybe): 
	- people on whom user subscribed
	- check what they read
	- their reviews
	- book packs

Possible implementation:
- Website
- Backend on Python
- Implement db with books
(ElasticSearch for db control?)

Goal: Service for tracking reading activity
