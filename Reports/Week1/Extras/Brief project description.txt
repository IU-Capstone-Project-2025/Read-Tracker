Website (NOT mobile app nor computer application) for book tracking
Books are not contained only their names (tracker, NOT online-reader)

Actions:
- Open site
- Check profile
- Check that user read today (FACT OF READING in calendar (on the right?))
- Check subscription feed (additional maybe): 
	- people on whom user subscribed
	- check what they read
	- their reviews:
		- potentially comment section after review to discuss it (?)
	- book packs
- Create own book packs (or collections in other words)
- Mark book as added for reading/reading right now/finished (Possibly mark which pages were read -> specify number of pages in book when adding)
- Add book for reading
- Write public/private reviews on books (user can choose private or public on its own)
- Create reading groups (?)
- Add book in read/want list (before adding book to actually reading?)
- Personalised suggestions on books (ML?)

Possible implementation:
- Website
- Backend on Python
- FastAPI
- Implement db with books
(ElasticSearch for db control?)

Examples:
https://readed.me/books
https://rj-ten.vercel.app/

Goals: 
1) Service for tracking reading activity (book diary)
2) Recommendation system to find new books
3) Forum (?) for writing review to the book
4) Discussion of the reviews

For potential future work:
- Possibly some of goals will remain untouched, use them
- Upgrade to social network maybe?
- Add actual online-reader (troubles with book author rights)
